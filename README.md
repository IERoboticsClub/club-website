## Development

1. Create a fork
2. Clone the fork to your local machine
3. Create a new branch [name it {username}-{feature}] or maybe connect the issue
4. Make changes and commit them to the branch on your fork
5. Create a pull request to the main repo from your fork and branch
6. Wait for the PR to be reviewed and merged :)
