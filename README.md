## Development Setup

Mostly you need to [modify your environment variables](https://www.phind.com/search?cache=ni84tgt3sykafm7y3vwidjlm).

```
cd backend
```

Open your favorite text editor and create a new file `.env`, then set the two required variables `MONGO_URL` and `MONGO_DB_NAME`. You will also need to setup mongodb locally, you can do this by installing it and then running `mongod`.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Now the backend should be running locally. In a new terminal:

```
cd fe-public
```

Open your favorite text editor (vim) and add to `.env`:

```
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

then run:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
