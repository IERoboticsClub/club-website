    <p id="body">The Robotics Club was started to encourage IE students to get involved and learn about the latest
        trends in Robotics & Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, we represent the university in national
        competitions and gather students to work on exciting new projects. Our mission is to deepen students' knowledge
        and enthusiasm for robotics by hosting workshops, AI paper discussions, and real projects.</p>
